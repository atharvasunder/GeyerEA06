Unified Model for Spring Mass Walking and Running

This is an implementation of a paper titled "Compliant leg behaviour explains basic dynamics of walking and running" by Hartmut Geyer, Andre Seyfarth, and Reinhard Blickhan. The paper shows how human walking and running mechanics can be explained to a great extent by a bipedal spring mass model.

Code consists of a MATLAB implementation of the model, along with files to make different plots in the paper such as return map analysis or feasible parameter domain checks.
