Unified Model for Spring Mass Walking and Running

This is an implementation of a paper titled "Compliant leg behaviour explains basic dynamics of walking and running" by Hartmut Geyer, Andre Seyfarth, and Reinhard Blickhan. The paper shows how human walking and running mechanics can be explained to a great extent by a bipedal spring mass model.

Code consists of a MATLAB implementation of the model, along with files to make different plots in the paper such as return map analysis or feasible parameter domain checks.

Abstract: The basic mechanics of human locomotion are associated with vaulting over stiff legs in walking and rebounding on compliant legs in running. However, while rebounding legs well explain the stance dynamics of running, stiff legs cannot reproduce that of walking. With a simple bipedal springâ€“mass model, we show that not stiff but compliant legs are essential to obtain the basic walking mechanics; incorporating the double support as an essential part of the walking motion, the model reproduces the characteristic stance dynamics that result in the observed small vertical oscillation of the body and the observed out-of-phase changes in forward kinetic and gravitational potential energies. Exploring the parameter space of this model, we further show that it not only combines the basic dynamics of walking and running in one mechanical system, but also reveals these gaits to be just two out of the many solutions to legged locomotion offered by compliant leg behaviour and accessed by energy or speed.
